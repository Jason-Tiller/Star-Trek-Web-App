# Star-Trek-Web-App
This web app allows one to obtain facts and characterists on various aliens via user input. A field guide to aliens.

*This app is no longer hosted online as the hosting service modified their terms of use.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Node.js

The focus on this project was backend development. I modified the Frontend to display the information that I wanted. Backend development included creating an API, moving the data from a local file to MongoDB, and insuring that the web app was able to communicate with the data.

## Optimizations

The API data was migrated to MongoDB to improve the user experience.
Will add additional Aliens to the database time permitting. As of now Humans, Vulcans, and Klingons are in the database.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to create an API and how to create a database on MongoDB.
